# ArrayExample

This is an application that allows a user to dynamically build a 2-dimensional array of varrying row lengths. 
Dynamic labels of the position are created and placed next to where the user input is expected for further clarity

In order to get this sample Java application running, follow these steps.
1. Create a new Java project
2. Create a new class and name it ArrayExample
3. Copy the java file within the src folder and paste into eclipse
4. The console prompts and comments break the application down piecemeal for further understanding
